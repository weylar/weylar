My name is Idris Aminu (Weylar). I'm an Android Engineer at KliQr, building [KliQr](https://kliqr.com) - a Personal Financial Management (PFM) that uses artificial intelligence, to evaluate, suggest and manage users' financial habits. 

I love developing for Android, and also enjoy building stuff with flutter ðŸ’–.

Thanks for checking out my profile.
