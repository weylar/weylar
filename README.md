My name is Idris Aminu (Weylar). I'm an Android Engineer at Grimaldi, building [Grimaldi](https://www.grimaldi.napoli.it/en/index.html) - a Personal Financial Management (PFM) app that uses artificial intelligence, to evaluate, suggest and manage users' financial habits. 

I love developing for Android, and also enjoy building stuff with flutter ðŸ’–. Apart from coding, I'm a prolific film watcher and new things "try-er".

Thanks for checking out my profile.
